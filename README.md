# Dodge-em
This is my semester project for programming fundamentals. It is a game implemented in C++ using graphics (Glut library) for interface.

#* For game execution:
1. First you have to install libraries by opening terminal in project folder and run a commad “ bash install-libraries.sh”
2. Then run “make” on terminal and it will create object files and game as out file.
3. To run the game write “./game” in terminal.
